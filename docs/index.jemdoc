== About Her

Wanning Ding is a Ph.D. student in the FSSL Lab of Computer Science at Syracuse University, under the guidance of Dr. Yuzhe Tang. She earned her B.E. from East China Normal University and her M.S. in Computer Science from Syracsue University. Her research centers on blockchain security, with a focus on improving the resilience of decentralized systems against attacks such as asymmetric mempool DoS and optimizing blockchain transaction processes.

Wanning has published papers in top-tier venues, including IEEE S&P and USENIX Security, where her work on the SAFERAD framework has contributed significantly to the field of blockchain security. Actively seeking internship opportunities for 2025, she aims to expand her expertise in security research and contribute to cutting-edge projects in the industry.
