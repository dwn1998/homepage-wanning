== About Her

Wanning Ding is a Ph.D. student in the FSSL Lab of Computer Science at Syracuse University, advised by Dr. Yuzhe Tang. She earned her B.E. from East China Normal University and her M.S. in Computer Science from Syracuse University. Her research focuses on blockchain security, particularly improving the resilience of decentralized systems against asymmetric mempool DoS attacks and optimizing transaction processing.

Her work has been published in top-tier venues including IEEE S&P and USENIX Security. Notably, her SAFERAD framework contributed significantly to enhancing Ethereumâ€™s mempool security. Wanning is actively seeking research internship opportunities for 2025 to deepen her expertise and collaborate on impactful projects in security.
